# Chess

This is a small sample project to showcase relevant coding skills as of 12/2022.

It contains the logic for a partial implementation of the rules of chess, namely:
* Board Setup and Piece tracking
* Valid movement for Pawns, including regular moves, capture moves, first moves and special move (En Passant) enabled by enemy pawn movement.

Subsequent planned enhancements are:
* Additional piece creation and movement
* Move decision making based on point value rolling average of the next 3 likely moves
*  API implementation


This project features a variety of uses of the C# language, such as:
* Flags with enums and corresponding bitwise operator use
* Delegates and lambdas
* LINQ to SQL and LINQ to Entities
* Switch expressions and pattern matching
* and more!

Unit tests have been added to allow exercising the project logic.

It is dedicated with love to my 10-year-old son, Knox, who loves the game of chess.
